This is not really a solution to the exercise but rather an example
of how an iterator could be implemented not as an object but rather
as a functional construct

-->
<script>
	function iterate(start,step,stop,fn) {
		for(var i=start;i<stop;i+=step) {
			fn(i);
		}
	}
	iterate(5,2,17,function(i) {
		document.write(i+"<br/>");
	});
</script>
