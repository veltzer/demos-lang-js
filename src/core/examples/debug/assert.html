<!--
	This example shows how to use the console.assert API
	Notes:
	- you can add as many messages as you like to the assert failure.
	- you do get a stack trace when the assertion fails (this you could do at any point
		using 'console.trace').
	- in contrast to what the documentation about this API says, this function DOES NOT throw
		an exception and execution continues after it.
