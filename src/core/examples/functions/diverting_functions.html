<!--
	An example of diverting javascript functions. In the case the native function document.write.
	Notice that we are inserting our own function as a replacement for the original "document.write".
	We are doing it on the actual document object.

<html>
	<head>
		<title>Title</title>
		<script>
			document.write("Hello, World!<br>");
			var oldfunc=document.write;
			document.write=function() {
				// no write for you
			};
			document.write("Where did this go ?");
			// these two do not work because it is a method and must be called from an object context
			try {
				oldfunc("This one is through oldfunc");
			} catch(e) {
				console.log("yes, got exception");
			}
			try {
				oldfunc(document,"This one is through oldfunc");
			} catch(e) {
				console.log("yes, got exception");
			}
			// this one would work:
			oldfunc.call(document,"hey there<br>");
			document.write=oldfunc;
			document.write("This is the proper write back<br>");
			document.write(oldfunc+"<br>");
