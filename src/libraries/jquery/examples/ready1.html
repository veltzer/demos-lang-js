<!--
	This example investigates the $.ready jQuery function.

	Notice that:
	- document.ready is called BEFORE images are loaded.
	- this is good if you want to do stuff quickly.
	- if you want to do image manipulation or intervene after images
	are loaded you can attach to their load event via $.load.
	- notice the many ways by which you can bind to the ready function.
	- the recommended way is the first one: $(document).ready(function).
	- notice that you can still bind method to "ready" even if you are
	within a ready handler.
	- notice that .bind events get called after regular .ready handlers.
