<!--
	A basic example showing the use of Ext.require

	Note:
	- You must do all of this in the context of Ext.onReady as the
	Ext.require system does not work properly until the ExtJs framework
	is ready.
	- You can pass a single class to Ext.require as first parameter or
	a whole array of classes. If passing a whole array then the function
	will only be executed after ALL the members of the array have been
	loaded. ExtJs actually tries to load independant classes IN PARALLEL
	to speed up the load time from the server. Mind you that after first
	time usage of your application the classes that you require will already
	be in the browsers cache and so this speedup only applies to the very
	first time when you run.
