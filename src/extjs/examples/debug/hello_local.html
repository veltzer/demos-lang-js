<!--
A basic local hello world example for ExtJs
local means that the extjs code itself comes from the local server.

Note:
- the require is not needed since we get "ext-all-debug.js" which brings
all the widgets with it.
- notice we write in the code in the "head" section of the HTML file.
	That is recommended.
- we also demo Ext.onReady and Ext.MessageBox.
- you can choose between different versions of ext-all (see below).
- Notice that the box that you get is not a real window and rather drawn on the
main screen. This is to circumvent any browser limitations about pop up boxes.
- notice that we do not need to Ext.require("Ext.MessageBox") because
Ext.MessageBox is supplied by the "ext-all.js" file.
